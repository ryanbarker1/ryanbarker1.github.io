            <li>2. Firewood can be removed from individual lots for
              personal use while at Sunridge and for home personal use.</li>
            <li>3. Firewood can not be used for commercial use or sold for personal gain.</li>
            <li>4. Firewood cannot be removed from common areas without specific written
              authorization from the Sunridge Board. The lot owner who desires to
              remove wood needs to inform the board of the date, time, and place
              and what they are going to use the wood for.
