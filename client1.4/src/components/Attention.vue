                <p>Sunridge Board Members;</p>
                <p>Regarding the Sunridge accounts that are still with us, and will be getting service through us, I am pleased to announce that we will be able to put everyone on a Community pricing.
                We will be starting the community pricing in 2018 since we are only making one more delivery this year. We will be able to keep the community price around $2.00 a gallon, and everyone would be charged the same,
                no one pays higher, and new residents would get their first fill at a lower price, but then pay the community price. We will have to look at pricing in the spring and see exactly what the price would be for that summer. </p>

            <p>Also, we are more than happy to put customers on a Minimum Tank Rental plan. Unfortunately, we cannot offer this to every customer, but we would be able to look at the accounts, and usage, and see if we would be able to.
              We are more than happy to do it for our customers, but will not be able to offer this to every single Sunridge customer.</p>

               <p> We understand that owning your own tank can be a huge hassle when something goes wrong on the tank. When you lease a tank through us of any size,
            you are not liable if anything is to go bad on the tank. Most reason a tank has issues is caused by a regulator malfunction,
            and you need to replace the regulator. Replacing a regulator costs approximately $125 (some more, others less), but only a licensed
            plumber can purchase these types of regulators. If you rent a tank, you do not have to worry about paying for a new regulator, or hiring
                 a plumber, we would replace it for you and do the work at no charge.</p>

            <p>I do want to apologize to everyone on the behalf of all of us in the AmeriGas Ogden office, on the
            challenges we were faced this year and how they affected you all personally. We are trying our best,
            and just ask for your patience during this time of struggle. We do sincerely apologize that some customers were over
            charged, and some customers didn’t receive service in the time frame they expected.
            We are and always will be more than willing to fix and pricing issues,
            or service issues you are faced with, we just need to be made aware of the issues,
              for we do not always catch them until the customer calls into us.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately I cannot tell the future, but I am hoping for a better year in the year
              of 2018. We will do all we can to make up for the problems we caused your community
              and not being able to service you in a good time frame. We are truly appreciative of the
              customers who have understood, and been with us since the take over of V1. We greatly appreciate
              all of your business and patience with us.</p>

            <p>We would be happy to continue serving, and helping the Sunridge community in any way we can.</p>

            <p>Thank you all for your continued business, we look forward to continue servicing your community.</p>



                Thank you;<br>

            <div class="card-text">
              <p>Myrtle Spurge (Donkey tail) has been spotted on Sunridge.  Contact with this weed is very dangerous!
                If someone gets the milky substance on them it will cause 3rd degree burns, and if it gets into your eyes
                you could lose your eye sight. All parts of this plant are considered poisonous!</p>

              <p>The most common victims of myrtle spurge are children who unassumingly pick the pretty flowers!</p>

               <p> It is a perennial that produces new stems from taproot each year.  The plants are 4 to
                 6 inches tall, have trailing stems, and fleshy, blue-green, triangle-shaped leaves.
                 In the spirng they produce clusters of small yellow flowers on top of each stem.</p>

                <p>Please take the time to download (and print for future reference) the pages
                  below for information on how to identify this weed as well as eradicate it from your lot!
