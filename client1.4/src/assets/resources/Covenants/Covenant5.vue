          Covenants may be

          Association newsletter (Ridgerunner), by special mailings to

          For a violation or breach of any of these Covenants or rules the Association
          shall be authorized to proceed at law or in equity to compel a compliance.
          Whenever a condition exists which may be in violation of these Covenants and restrictions
          , the Association shall provide written notice of the violation to the Property Owner by
          certified mail or personal delivery.  The notification shall allow thirty days to
          correct the violation or seek Board approval of a variance.  Should a Property Owner fail to comply,
          the Association may correct the violation and bill the owner for the expense.
          Should expenses of such removal not be paid within thirty days, the Association may place
          a lien against the Lot for the amount of the expenses and collect the expenses in the same
          manner as regular assessments are collected as provided herein.</td>
