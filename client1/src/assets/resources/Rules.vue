          Rules</p>
          <p class="sans">The ability to identify all riders has already been a real tool in helping
            us provide accountability, and reduce the number of non-Sunridge riders
            that had managed to get in from adjoining areas.<br>
            <br>
            ALL ATV TYPE VEHICLES MUST HAVE PLATES! We will deny access
            to anyone that does not have properly identification plates (whether
            on a transport trailer, or in use). If you plan to have a guest
            in for a tour of Sunridge for an hour, or for a week end visit&#8230;.even
            visitor ATV&#8217;s types vehicles must be tagged. If the security
            guard is not there to remind you, you are not permitted to by-pass
            this security rule. We have done all we can to resist having
            to fine offending non-compliant riders, but we will not allow
            any exceptions. If you have any questions to ask&#8230;do so.
            But please be a part of the solution here with all your neighbors&#8230;not
            a part of the problem. We&#8217;ve gone through a lot of effort
            to make these available&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;please help us all
            out, and use them&#8230;..or ride elsewhere. Thank you.</p>
          <p class="sans">Any questions please call a member of the board. Tags can be ordered from
            Bruce Johnson.</p></td>

          <p class="sans">It is important to remember
            that the Sunridge water system is one of the most important assets that
            we have and depend on throughout the years. The water system in Sunridge
            is owned and controlled by the Sunridge Property Owners and managed by
            the Board of Trustees. This means that we are responsible for maintaining
            the quality and safety of the water, so please help us by following the
            rules for connecting and developing your water system on your property.</p><br />

          <p class="sans" align="left">1. All connections to the water system must be pre-approved by the Sunridge
            water officer.<br /><br />
            2. The actual connection work must be performed by a Sunridge authorized
            contractor.<br /><br />
            3. Each connection must include a stop and waste valve, to
            assure	the safety of the water in the water system, an anti back flow
            valve	at
            the connection point. <br />
            <br />
            4. Sunridge Board of Trustee reserves the right to inspect any water
            system that is connected to the Sunridge water system for health and
            safety purposes.</p>
          <p class="sans">It is important to remember that protecting Sunridge and keeping it
            safe requires that we all follow the rules and work together for our
            common goals. Thank you for your cooperation. We all value the quality
            time we spend in Sunridge, and with your help we can continue to have
            a high quality water system that is safe for everyone.</p>
