          The use of sheds on Sunridge properties is governed by Weber
          County Zoning Codes. To obtain approval from the Board to construct
          a shed or other man
          made structure, first obtain a Weber County Land Use Permit.
          Attach a copy of the permit to your request for construction
          approval, addressed to the
          Sunridge Architectural Approvals Committee. Weber County Zoning
          Code allows no plumbing of any kind (water, drains, sewage,
          etc.) in a shed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td>
